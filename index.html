          <p>
            The protagonist of Persona 5 is a transfer student at Shujin Academy.
            At the beginning of the game, he has little to no power or influence 
            in the world and is restrained by the rules of the system he was born into.
            As per tradition of the Megami Tensei franchise, he is a silent protagonist,
            whose personality is based on the player's actions and decisions.

            Ryuji has short spiky dyed blond hair and dark brown eyes. According 
            to Sadayo Kawakami, his hair is naturally black. He has a noticeable
            widow's peak and his eyebrows are unusual in that he lacks the outer 
            sides. He is shown to be muscular.

            Ann is a very kind and compassionate girl, enough for it to be noted
            by both Morgana and Sojiro Sakura. Years of isolation due to her 
            looks have left her very withdrawn, with the belief that she's lost
            her place in the world. This hasn't stopped her from opening up to
            the people close to her and making jokes. She's able to press on 
            without caring about the opinion of others due to her friendship
            with Shiho Suzui, who was her first real friend in Japan before 
            joining the Phantom Thieves.

            Yusuke has dark blue hair with parted bangs slightly covering his
            left eye and gray eyes. His in-game character model is noticeably
            taller and thinner than those of other male characters. His fellow
            Phantom Thieves Ann Takamaki and Ryuji Sakamoto both describe him
            as a "pretty boy" on seperate occasions.

            Makoto has brown hair in a bob cut with blunt bangs and a French-braid

            as they have been depicted as red, although her eye color in her 
            portraits can be interpreted as a reddish-brown. She is of average
            female height, being taller than Futaba Sakura and Haru Okumura, 
            but slightly shorter than Ann Takamaki.

            She wears large black circular glasses, and she is always seen 
            wearing a set of AKG K845BT headphones with red earpads. She seems

            Haru is generally very shy and reserved. At school, she is viewed 
            as eccentric due to her tendency to keep to herself and avoid contact
            with others as much as possible. She has serious trust issues, 
            finding it difficult to differentiate between who truly values 
            her as a friend, and who merely wants to use her for her family's 
            status. This is due to her past, where not only friends, but adults
            and teachers would be kind at her just to please her father and 
            smiled at her for their own personal gain.

            quite clumsy and careless, as she is shown outright missing the mark
            at the batting cages even if her reflexes are usually excellent, and
            she lets her phone's battery run out while texting the protagonist.

            The protagonist is a second-year high school student who transfers to Shujin Academy in Tokyo, after a false assault
            charge issued by a high-profile politician, which caused him to end up with a one-year probation sentence. Prior to the
            incident, it is stated that he lived in a rural area. He lives in a coffee shop called Café Leblanc, located in Yongen-Jaya
            and owned by Sojiro Sakura, an acquaintance of his parents during his probation.

            Ryuji Sakamoto is a student of Shujin Academy and has known Ann Takamaki since middle school, though they were only 
            acquaintes. Ryuji borrowed money from Ann in middle school so he could buy a stuffed dolphin for his mom from a school
            trip, but never paid her back, which Ann holds against him.

            Ann is a second year high schooler at Shujin Academy. Ann is the classmate of the protagonist in 2-D, 
            and she and Ryuji Sakamoto were classmates in middle school. Due to her foreign blood and living abroad 
            before the story, she does not have many friends there and is considered an outcast in Shujin. According 
            to the art book, her parents are away from home and she lives with "servants." Ann mentions she had a live-in
            caretaker, so these "servants" are likely caretakers. Both her parents are fashion designers who put on extravagant 
            shows, and they jump from country to country, so Ann does not see them that often. It is revealed that Ann also used 
            to live in Finland.

            Yusuke is an honor student who takes an art course at Kosei High School. He was raised by Madarame as his mother died when 
            he was three. Therefore, he does not remember her and Madarame took great care of him. As he grew up, he was tutored in art 
            by Madarame, with his masterpiece "Sayuri" being one of his greatest inspirations for his artistic career. In reality, Madarame
            only raised Yusuke for the sole purpose of exhibiting his artwork using his name, and he would often give him meager rations 
            during his tutelage. By the time the game begins, most other pupils in Madarame's shack are cast away, died because of direct
            or indirect abuse by him, left due to losing interest in art, and Yusuke is the last pupil living in his atelier.

            The Niijima sisters Makoto and Sae lived alongside their father since their mother died when they were young. 
            As he was not home often, the sisters disliked him. Unfortunately, three years ago, he was murdered by being ran over 
            by a truck in the line of duty, forcing the elder sister Sae to juggle between handling cases in court and raising Makoto 
            alone. In order to retain the 99% indiction rate of her country's courts, Sae also more often than not, found herself 
            having to rig cases with a guilty charge against her will. As a result, she saw both Makoto and their father as a burden 
            and did not hold her in high regard. Makoto also regretted disliking her father and wished that he would still be around.

            Futaba is the daughter of cognitive psientist Wakaba Isshiki; her father is unknown. Due to her high intelligence 
            compared to other children around her, she was bullied often and barely had any friends other than a girl named Kana. 
            However, Kana's parents were sexually harassing their daughter, and when Futaba discovered this, Kana left her as well.

            Haru is a third year student in Shujin Academy and the daughter of the current president of Okumura Foods, 
            Kunikazu Okumura. While Okumura used to genuinely care for his daughter, by the time the events of the game 
            began, he had grown so corrupt and over-ambitious that he is willing to do anything he can do to gain absolute
            power. She didn't mind at first despite Okumura was overworking employees, but she eventually became a bargaining 
            chip for his ambitions, in which she has been forced into an arranged marriage with the son of a prospective associate
            of her father's, Sugimura for the sole reason that his status will allow Okumura to achieve presidency.

            Both sisters, training to be gymnasts, were on good terms with each other and shared the same coach, Hiraguchi. Kasumi 
            was a quick learner, but Sumire had trouble remembering most of her moves. However, her coach rewarded the sisters with ice 
            cream for good performances, which Kasumi would always share with her no matter what. Kasumi also arranges most of the sisters' 
            daily life, including Sumire's bedroom, with the exception of preparing dishes, since compared to Sumire, she was a mediocre 
            cook. Eventually, both sisters promised to go to internationals as a sister duo.
